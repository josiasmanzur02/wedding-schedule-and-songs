    <h2>Wedding Hymns</h2>

    <div class="hymn-title">O Glorious Divine</div>
    <pre>
        Since long before the world began,
        In Your heart You longed for a Bride;
        This mutual dwelling, Your glorious plan;
        With me e'er to abide.
        Not knowing Your heart,
        I sinned and thus should die;
        Yet You shed Your blood to set me free.
        You gave me Your life, to me drew nigh;
        Wondrous love! We two one forever will be.

        O glorious divine love! How can I fathom,
        Higher than the sky, deeper than the sea;
        It crushes death's pow'r and Satan's kingdom;
        Nothing can compare with Your love to me;
        So fervid and so deep, so gentle and so true;
        I'm in love, Lord, with You.
        I give you my heart, my life and my soul,
        Come suffering or joy whatever betide.
        By Your boundless grace,
        I'll lay down my all
        To build up Your church,
        Your glorious Bride;
        Your heart to satisfy, mutual abode we'll be
        in eternity.
    </pre>

    <div class="hymn-title">The Church is Christ's Deep Longing (Hymn #1229)</div>
    <pre>
        The church is Christ's deep longing
        And His good pleasure too.
        His every word and action
        Is made with her in view.
        His heart's love is established,
        And nought can Him deter;
        Before the earth's foundation
        His thoughts were filled with her.

        The eve of all creation
        He mused on His delight,
        And pondered every feature,
        Well-pleasing in His sight.
        Creation sprang to being,
        But deep in Him did hide
        A heart of depth unfathomed
        Fixed on a glorious Bride.

        And thus His will was 'stablished
        His counterpart to gain;
        This blessed, firm intention,
        Eternally the same,
        Though sin should e'en beguile man,
        Then mock his helpless state,
        He never could forsake her,
        His yearning ne'er abate.

        Then mercy richly flourished,
        And love was, oh, so vast,
        As graciously He sought her
        With wisdom unsurpassed.
        The love He gave to win her
        God only comprehends!
        His life laid down, an offering
        Whose fragrance yet ascends.

        And now in resurrection
        To her He draws most near,
        And with untold affection
        In glory does appear.
        As she beholds her Bridegroom,
        His glory floods her heart,
        'Til she, His Bride, is raptured,
        His longed-for counterpart.
