      <a id="song1" class="song-link">The Church is Christ's Deep Longing (Hymn #1229)</a>
      <div class="hymn-text">
        <p>The church is Christ's deep longing<br>
        And His good pleasure too.<br>
        His every word and action<br>
        Is made with her in view.<br>
        His heart's love is established,<br>
        And nought can Him deter;<br>
        Before the earth's foundation<br>
        His thoughts were filled with her.</p>

        <p>The eve of all creation<br>
        He mused on His delight,<br>
        And pondered every feature,<br>
        Well-pleasing in His sight.<br>
        Creation sprang to being,<br>
        But deep in Him did hide<br>
        A heart of depth unfathomed<br>
        Fixed on a glorious Bride.</p>

        <p>And thus His will was 'stablished<br>
        His counterpart to gain;<br>
        This blessed, firm intention,<br>
        Eternally the same,<br>
        Though sin should e'en beguile man,<br>
        Then mock his helpless state,<br>
        He never could forsake her,<br>
        His yearning ne'er abate.</p>

        <p>Then mercy richly flourished,<br>
        And love was, oh, so vast,<br>
        As graciously He sought her<br>
        With wisdom unsurpassed.<br>
        The love He gave to win her<br>
        God only comprehends!<br>
        His life laid down, an offering<br>
        Whose fragrance yet ascends.</p>

        <p>And now in resurrection<br>
        To her He draws most near,<br>
        And with untold affection<br>
        In glory does appear.<br>
        As she beholds her Bridegroom,<br>
        His glory floods her heart,<br>
        'Til she, His Bride, is raptured,<br>
        His longed-for counterpart.</p>
      </div>

      <a id="song2" class="song-link">O Glorious Divine</a>
      <div class="hymn-text">
        <p>Since long before the world began,<br>
        In Your heart You longed for a Bride;<br>
        This mutual dwelling, Your glorious plan;<br>
        With me e'er to abide.<br>
        Not knowing Your heart,<br>
        I sinned and thus should die;<br>
        Yet You shed Your blood to set me free.<br>
        You gave me Your life, to me drew nigh;<br>
        Wondrous love! We two one forever will be.</p>

        <p>O glorious divine love! How can I fathom,<br>
        Higher than the sky, deeper than the sea;<br>
        It crushes death's pow'r and Satan's kingdom;<br>
        Nothing can compare with Your love to me;<br>
        So fervid and so deep, so gentle and so true;<br>
        I'm in love, Lord, with You.<br>
        I give you my heart, my life and my soul,<br>
        Come suffering or joy whatever betide.<br>
        By Your boundless grace,<br>
        I'll lay down my all<br>
        To build up Your church,<br>
        Your glorious Bride;<br>
        Your heart to satisfy, mutual abode we'll be<br>
        in eternity.</p>
